# Plant_Watering_Device

This script was made to run from a raspberry pi connecte to a water pump solenoid through GPIO pins.

The script can be run through ssh from any device, allowing the user to water their plants from anywhere with an internet connection.

A picture of the solenoid setup is available in the uploaded files.
